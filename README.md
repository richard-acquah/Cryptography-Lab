# Cryptography-Lab

## Objectives
These cryptography labs demostrate how to install cryptographic tools and how it is used to encrypt and decrypt file. This lab focuses encrypting and decrypting files using ccrypt and openssl in Kali linux. The lab is a demostration of symmetric encryption and how a single key is used to encrypt and decrypt files.

## Skills Learned
+ File encryption and decryption.
+ Enhanced knowledge in encryption algorithms.
+ Indepth understanding of Symmetric encryption.

## Resources / Tools / Utilities
